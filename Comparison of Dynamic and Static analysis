# Static vs Dynamic Analysis

## Static Analysis Strengths
- Reveals file parsing logic, conditional branches, PE structure
- Safe, offline, no malware execution needed
- Best for understanding internal design and IOCs

## Dynamic Analysis Strengths
- Confirms runtime behavior: encryption, ransom note deployment, persistence
- Observes scripts, child processes, file modification
- Best for impact verification and incident response

## Comparison Summary
| Aspect | Static | Dynamic |
|--------|--------|---------|
| File/Path Logic | ✔ | Inferred only |
| Encryption | ❌ | ✔ |
| Persistence | ❌ | ✔ |
| Ransom GUI | ❌ | ✔ |
| Safety | ✔ | ⚠ |

> **Conclusion:** Both methods complement each other; static explains "how", dynamic confirms "what".
